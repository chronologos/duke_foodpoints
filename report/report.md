Project Demo. At the end of the semester, you will need to present a working demo of your system.
Instructions on how to sign up for the demo will be given during the second to last week of the class. Prior to
your demo, submit the following via websubmit, under “compsci316” and “proj-final”:

• A project report, including a brief description of your application, the E/R diagram for your database
design, assumptions that you are making about the data being modeled, and the list of database tables
with descriptions.
• A .zip or .tar.gz archive of all your source code. The source code directory should also contain a
README file describing how to set up your servers and database, and how to compile and deploy your
application
